# DE-STRESS Front End

This repository contains the code to build the front end of the DE-STRESS web
application. DE-STRESS stands for Designed structure evaluation services and it allows
users to:

1. Create requirement specifications for their design i.e. a formal description of the
   properties their protein must have to be fit for purpose.
1. Automatically evaluate protein designs using a range of metrics.
1. Compare their designs against their specification in order to select the most
   promising design candidates.

## Development

The front end to DE-STRESS is written in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/), so you'll need to
download and install the Elm compiler. I'm currenlty using
[`create-elm-app`](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app) to develop the
application, which gives a nice development server too.
